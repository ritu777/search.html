<img src="steps.png"></img> <br>

<h2 style="color:mediumpurple; display:inline"><u>Crawling:</h2></u>
<p style="color:black;display:inline"> It is the discovery process in which search engines send out a team of robots (known as crawlers or spiders)to find new and updated content. Content can vary- it colud be a webpage, an image, a video, a PDF,etc.</p><br><br>

<h2 style="color:lime; display:inline"><u>Indexing:</h2></u>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">Once a search engine processes each of the pages it crawls, it compiles a massive index of all the words it sees and their location on each page. It is essentially a database of billions of web pages.</p><br><br>
<h2 style="color:pink;display:inline"><u>Ranking:</h2></u>
<p style ="color:black;display:inline"> While the two previous activities are the “behind-the-scenes” of the work of search engines, ranking is the most evident one. When someone performs a search, search engines scour their index for highly relevant content and then orders that content in the hopes of solving the searcher's query. This ordering of search results by relevance is known as ranking. In general, you can assume that the higher a website is ranked, the more relevant the search engine believes that site is to the query.</p><br><br>

<h2>3. Explain web crawling? What’s a crawler?</h2>

<h2 style="color:crimson; display:inline"><u>WEB CRAWLING:</h2></u>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">Web crawling is the process of indexing data on web pages by using a program or automated script. These automated scripts or programs are known by multiple names, including web crawler, spider, spider bot, and often shortened to crawler.</p><br><br>
<h2 style="color:slateblue; display:inline"><u>CRAWLER:</h2></u>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">A web crawler, or spider, is a type of bot that is typically operated by search engines like Google and Bing. Their purpose is to index the content of websites all across the internet so that those websites can appear in search engine results.</p><br><br>

<h2>4. What is meant by "cached" while searching?</h2>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">In the context of searching, the term "cache" refers to a temporary storage location where data or information is stored for quick retrieval. When you perform a search, especially on the internet, various systems and applications involved in the search process utilise caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce the load on servers.</p><br><br>
<h2>5. What's an organic result?</h2>

<p style="color:black;display:inline">Organic search results are the unpaid listings that appear on a search engine results. Organic search results are the query results which are calculated strictly algorithmically, and not affected by advertiser payments.</p><br><br>
<h2>6. What is paid result?</h2>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">Paid search results have a little green box with the word “Ad” before the listing; this is where a company, like yours, has paid to have their page show up at the top of the list. This can be done through Google Ads search campaign, which charges you a small amount of money for every person who clicks on that link.</p><br><br>
<h2>7. What is meant by "bounce rate"?</h2>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">Bounce Rate is defined as the percentage of visitors that leave a webpage without taking an action, such as clicking on a link, filling out a form, or making a purchase.
Bounce Rate may be used as a Google Ranking factor.</p><br>
<h2>8. What makes a website appear higher up in search results?</h2>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">There are five ways to make a website appear higher up.</p><br>
<ul style="color:black;display:inline">
<li>High click-through rates</li>
<li>Website and domain age</li>
<li>It has relevant high quality backlinks</li>
<li>High quality content</li>
<li>Site links are growing at a steady rate</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. How does your past search activity affects your search results?</h2>
<p style="color:black;display:inline">If you regularly search for similar keywords, Google will begin offering results (and sometimes ads) based on your previous searches. The impact on your results is subtle, but once Google has your search data it will try to predict who and/or what you meant based on your previous queries.</p><br>
